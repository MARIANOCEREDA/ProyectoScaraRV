# ProyectoScaraRV

Virtual Reality Project.

The project consists of a human-machine interface, composed of 2 MPU sensors connected to the arm of a user. The sensors measure the angle of movement of the arm and forearm respectively, and this information is sent to a computer, where the simulation of a scara robot is running in Unity and developed in C#.
